# Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Date: 
Project work and research took place from: 2/22/25-5/8/25


### Number of hours: 
I spent appriximately 63.2 hours of work on this project. This included reseach, writing code, meetings with Dr. Wetherell and testing the game.

### Rose:
Something I found rewarding with this project was realizing I can fully put together a project for a real-life situation. Meaning, creating a game that Dr. Wetherell will be distributing amoung the students in her classes. I also was proud that after writing 700+ lines of code, I was able to get an entire project to run smoothly.

### Bud: 
I am looking forward to applying the skills and logic I learned from creating this game and using it for future RShiny games. I also discovered a way to store leaderboard data via Google Sheets, which will be useful for the future.

### Thorn: 
The most challenging aspect of this project was attepting to get the sound to work efficiently. I was able to implement it in a functioning way, but I would like to perfect to code used so I can use it for future projects. Also, I would like to attept to use Visual Studio to store a functioning leaderboard for future games.

## Additional thoughts
Always remember to have a seperate UI and Server script to send an RShiny project to shinyapps.io
Find a way to simplify code so it is easy to keep track of (condense it)
